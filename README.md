## Description

**Guess WHO ? Web Game** is a web implementation of the classic "Indovina Chi?" board game.  
In this game, a secret character is chosen at random and the player must figure out which one it is by asking questions or directly selecting a character. The project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It uses the Canvas API to render a dynamic 2D board that displays a grid of character cards (complete with emoticons and names), and it leverages open source libraries such as Bootstrap for responsive layout and Anime.js for smooth animations.

## Features

- **Responsive and Modern UI:**  
  The game is rendered in a single HTML page with a clean, modern interface. The layout adjusts thanks to Bootstrap’s grid system.

- **Canvas-Based Animation:**  
  Uses the HTML5 Canvas API to render the animated board, character cards, and interactive elements with fluid transitions.

- **Dynamic Character Board:**  
  The game randomly selects a secret character. All characters (represented with emoticons and names) are displayed in a grid, and clicking on a character verifies whether it matches the secret one.

- **Extensible Gameplay:**  
  The code is structured to be easily extended—adding new characters, attributes or questions between characters is straightforward.

- **Interactive Feedback:**  
  Animations (using Anime.js) and visual cues (hover effects and scaling) provide feedback when characters are selected, and results (correct/incorrect) are shown immediately.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:**  
   Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

2. **Gameplay:**  
   - The game randomly selects a secret character that is *not* shown to the player.
   - The board displays a grid of character cards using emoticons and character names.
   - Click on the character card you believe matches the secret character.
   - If you choose the correct character, the game will show a celebratory message with animations; otherwise, the card will be dimmed to indicate that option is excluded.
   
3. **Extending the Game:**  
   You can add more characters, sophisticated filtering questions, or even new game modes by modifying the code.
